## What is ARP spoofing?
ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoodef) Addres resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. The aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the OP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.
